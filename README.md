## About Reclaimer
Reclaimer is a tool for viewing and exporting data in game files. While it's designed for Halo games, its also possible for developers to create plugins which could support other games, or add additional features related to Halo.

Reclaimer is intended for modding purposes, such as porting Halo content between different Halo games (such as Custom Edition, back in the day) as well as for content creators to use as reference and/or make cool renders/animations with, like Machinima and SFM for example.

Be sure to check out the [Reclaimer Architect](https://github.com/Gravemind2401/Reclaimer.Architect "Reclaimer Architect") plugin (Halo3+) for scenario editing capabilities akin to Sapien from Halo Custom Edition.

### Supported Files
In general, Reclaimer works with these kinds of files:
- `.map` files from Halo 1 to Halo 4 (Xbox)
- `.yelo`  files from Halo Custom Edition (Open Sauce enhanced)
- `.s3dpak` files (decompressed) from Halo CE Anniversary
- `.map` files from Halo MCC PC
- `.module` files from Halo 5 and Halo Infinite

Using AMF model files will require either the [3DS Max](https://github.com/Gravemind2401/Reclaimer/blob/master/Reclaimer.Blam/Resources/3dsMax%20AMF2.ms "3DS Max") import script or the [Blender](https://github.com/Gravemind2401/Reclaimer/blob/master/Reclaimer.Blam/Resources/Blender%20AMF2.py "Blender") import script.
