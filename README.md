## About Reclaimer
Reclaimer is a tool for viewing and exporting assets from game files. While it's designed for Halo games, its also possible for developers to create plugins which could support other games, or add additional features related to Halo.

Reclaimer is intended for modding purposes like as porting assets between different Halo games as well as for content creators to use as reference and/or make cool renders/animations with, like Machinima and SFM for example.

### Supported Files
In general, Reclaimer works with these kinds of files:
- `.map` files from Halo 1 to Halo 4 (Xbox)
- `.yelo`  files from Halo Custom Edition (Open Sauce enhanced)
- `.map` files from Halo MCC PC
- `.module` files from Halo 5 and Halo Infinite
- `.s3dpak` files from Halo CE Anniversary (Xbox 360)
- `.s3dpak` and `.ipak` files from Halo CE Anniversary (MCC)

### Exporting Geometry Files
See the [RMF Importer README](https://github.com/Gravemind2401/Reclaimer/blob/master/Reclaimer.RMFImporter/README.md) for information on importing RMF files and setting up the RMF importer addon for Blender or 3DS Max.

AMF file exports have been deprecated - please use the RMF format instead.
- *Existing AMF files can still be imported using either the [3DS Max](https://github.com/Gravemind2401/Reclaimer/blob/master/Reclaimer.Blam/Resources/3dsMax%20AMF2.ms) import script or the [Blender](https://github.com/Gravemind2401/Reclaimer/blob/master/Reclaimer.Blam/Resources/Blender%20AMF2.py) import script.*
